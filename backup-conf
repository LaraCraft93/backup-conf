# Special VÃ¡riables
# You can define a special variable for change the diff tool
# A variable looks like this: #?variable. See below:
#?DIFFPROGRAM /usr/bin/diff
#?USE_GIT 0

# HOW TO USE:
#
# Each line support the specification of one file.
# E.g.:
/etc/backup-conf.conf
# The line above will backup the backup-conf configs into:
# <CURRENT_FOLDER>/etc/backup-conf.conf
# The folder structure inside <CURRENT_FOLDER> will be same
# from original location, except for files into /home/<user>,
# these files will be backed up into: <CURRENT_FOLDER>/HOME/
# (you can use $HOME variable, it will be expanded to /home/<user>)

# TIPS:
#
# For backup all files from a folder, use a syntax like this:
# $(find <folder> -type f)
# All symlinks will be ignored.
# For more info about how it work, read the man pages from 'find' command.
#
# NOTE: $(<command>) only work if the result of command is a list of
# absolute paths, one per line. (and when say "result", I mean stdout)
#
# That's all
